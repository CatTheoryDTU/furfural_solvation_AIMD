*** Furfural solvation at metal|water interfaces ***

1. This package includes all scripts and main data for plotting major figures in the manuscript.

2. In the catmap folder, input file is the input.txt for mkm and furfural_hydro_vacuum.mkm is mkm.file.

3. In the structure folder, you could find cif files of calculated metal|water|furfural models in AIMD simulations.

4. In the scripts folder, you could find the scripts to replot all the figures presented in the main text.

5. Software: VASP 5.4.4, catmap 0.3.1; DFT functional: RPBE-D3
